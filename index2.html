            <div class="container" id="prose">
            <h1>PROSE</h1>
            </div>

        <div class="row">

            According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, prose is "the ordinary language people use in speaking or writing". This coming Valentine's Day, hearts and minds will collide.
            We have to express our love through our words to our loved ones. With that, we must be articulate in expressing our feelings to our significant other. 
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
            You may ask yourself, "How can I be articulate in expressing myself to my significant other?"
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
            Well, first, you must be clear with the message that you want your partner to hear from you. You can start it off with an endearing greeting!
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
            An example would be "Hey Honey! Happy Valentine's Day. I remember during our first date, you were laughing so hard at my jokes, wine spilled out of your nose! I recalled that it was the moment that I truly fell madly and deeply in love with you."
            </div>
            <div class="row">
            Your significant other would really feel how much you love them with all of your being. Grammar is also important because the receiver may read misleading messages that would really get you into trouble so always double check your grammar.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
            Lastly, compose a poetry. It doesn't have to be overly-dramatic like Shakespeare's but, your partner would really appreciate it if they saw that you really took the time and extreme effort to write a poem for them to express your unconditional love for them. Don't be too meticulous or activate your perfectionist mode because it might sound like an academic paper instead of a love confession.
